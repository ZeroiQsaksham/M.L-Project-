# Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to solve a [briefly describe the problem here, e.g., "classification of images", "regression analysis on stock prices", etc.]. It leverages various libraries and algorithms to achieve optimal performance and accuracy.

## Project Structure

- **`ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Directory where the dataset is stored (make sure you have proper references if youâ€™re sharing the dataset).
- **`models/`**: Directory to store the trained models.
- **`results/`**: Directory containing results such as evaluation metrics, graphs, and predictions.
- **`scripts/`**: Additional Python scripts for data handling, model training, etc.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (or other relevant ML libraries)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- Any other specific libraries your project uses

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
