# Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to solve [briefly describe the problem here, e.g., "classification of images", "regression analysis on stock prices", etc.]. The implementation is done using Python, leveraging popular ML libraries.

## Project Structure

- **`ML_Project.py`**: Main Python script containing the workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Directory where the dataset is stored (ensure proper references if youâ€™re sharing the dataset).
- **`models/`**: Directory to store the trained models.
- **`results/`**: Directory containing results such as evaluation metrics, graphs, and predictions.
- **`scripts/`**: Additional Python scripts for data handling, model training, etc.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (or other relevant ML libraries)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- Any other specific libraries your project uses

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
